## Introduction

Hey, fellow IT enthusiasts! If you're anything like me, you've probably pondered the age-old question (okay, maybe not that old): "Which Linux distribution should I choose for my AWS workloads?" Well, fear not! In this blog post, we're going to dive deep into the epic battle between Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Amazon Linux. So, grab your popcorn and let's find out which contender comes out on top!

## Meet the Contenders: Amazon Linux vs. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Support Showdown

Before we dive into the thrilling comparison, let's introduce our contenders and their support capabilities. Amazon Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) may both be popular Linux distributions, but they're backed by different companies and cater to different needs.

### Provider and Focus: Cloud Champion vs. All-Rounder

Amazon Linux is the brainchild of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is designed with one mission in mind: dominating the AWS cloud infrastructure and services. It's all about optimizations and tight integrations for peak performance and management within the AWS ecosystem.

On the other hand, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is brought to you by Red Hat (a subsidiary of IBM) and prides itself on being a versatile general-purpose Linux distribution. RHEL is ready to tackle various use cases, from on-premises to cloud and hybrid environments.

### Long-term Support: The Test of Time

Amazon Linux 2 offers long-term support, with updates and security patches provided until June 30, 2023. RHEL, however, boasts a 10-year life cycle for each major release, complete with updates, security patches, and extended support options.

### Support Plans: Choose Your Fighter

When it comes to support plans, AWS has got you covered with a range of options for Amazon Linux. From Basic support (free of charge) to Enterprise support, you'll have access to 24/7 technical support, infrastructure event management, and more.

Red Hat also offers a variety of support plans for RHEL, including Standard and Premium subscriptions, giving you access to software updates, expert technical support, and an arsenal of resources.

### Documentation and Resources: Knowledge is Power

Both AWS and Red Hat provide comprehensive documentation for their respective distributions, covering installation, configuration, management, and troubleshooting. No matter which side you choose, you'll be armed with the knowledge to succeed.

### Security: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay

Amazon Linux and RHEL each have dedicated security teams working tirelessly to monitor and patch their operating systems, ensuring a secure environment for you and your data.

### Certification and Training: Show Off Your Skills

Red Hat offers a robust certification and training program for RHEL, including the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) and Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) certifications.

While Amazon doesn't offer specific certifications for Amazon Linux, they do have AWS certifications that cover various aspects of their cloud services, which may indirectly involve Amazon Linux.

## The Killer Features: Amazon Linux Takes the Lead

### 1. Cost - Wallets Rejoice!

Amazon Linux is a real wallet-saver. AWS Support includes Amazon Linux support comparable to Red Hat support, but without the extra cost above any existing AWS support plan. So, if you're cost-conscious (who isn't?), Amazon Linux has got your back.

### 2. Patching - Smooth Sailing

Who doesn't love seamless patch management? Amazon Linux machines are automatically patched on reboot, ensuring your instances stay up-to-date and secure without any fuss. Now that's a hassle-free experience!

### 3. Compliance - Check Those Boxes

Want to keep compliance officers happy? Amazon Linux has a nifty trick up its sleeve. With Image Builder, you can bake CIS controls right into your Amazon Linux images. Compliance? Check!

### 4. Networking - The Need for Speed

Amazon Linux is the Fast and the Furious of the Linux world when it comes to networking. It supports the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA), which offers lower latency, higher throughput, and lower CPU utilization. Plus, Amazon Linux is optimized for Amazon VPC, making network management a breeze.

### 5. Storage - Turbocharged Performance

Amazon Linux and AWS storage services like EBS and S3 are a match made in heaven. Tuned drivers and configurations make storage performance sing, while EBS-optimized instances amp up throughput and IOPS. It's like giving your storage a nitro boost!

### 6. Compute - Unleashing the Beast

Amazon Linux is like a finely tuned race car built for the AWS track. Its kernel is tailored for AWS infrastructure, revving up performance and resource utilization for EC2 instances. Amazon Linux plays well with all kinds of EC2 instance types, including those with specialized hardware. And let's not forget its knack for optimizing CPU utilization. Vroom, vroom!

## The Grand Finale: And the Winner Is...

When it comes to flexing those cloud muscles on AWS, Amazon Linux takes the crown. With its cost savings, streamlined patch management, compliance prowess, and top-notch networking, storage, and compute performance, it's a force to be reckoned with. Sure, RHEL is a solid and versatile Linux distribution, but when it comes to AWS workloads, Amazon Linux reigns supreme.

At the end of the day, the choice between RHEL and Amazon Linux boils down to your specific needs, priorities, and your team's expertise. But if you're looking to conquer the AWS landscape, Amazon Linux is your trusty steed. Now, go forth and conquer the cloud!
