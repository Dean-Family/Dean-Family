# DeanFam Publishing

I have begun learning how to publish using open source tools. This is been a very fun experience, and I am looking forward to continuing to learn more. In this process, I want to create a blog to record the process by which I do this. This is that blog. 

What I have in mind specifically is to use things like ChatGPT, or other large language models to generate content and publish that content, along with public domain materials in a way that is uncopyrightable in the United States. All would be in the public domain.

So what goes into the book or books cannot be copyrighted but this blog can. It will be licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license so just assume that it's licensed as such even if you can't find my license file for whatever reason. 

Licensing will be a big part of this story as well copyright by choosing to play with content in the public domain and degenerate content for the public domain I am trying to create a sort of meta-art. That is the content that is published will be its own art, but the way in which it was done is to create something of a commentary on the system of copyright itself. My main refrain is just think of what would be possible if a lot more was in the public domain. Public domain used to take affect much sooner and there's no reason why we couldn't go back . I want to take advantage of what is already out there to show a glimpse of what could be done.

I've got a couple ideas on what we can do. The first is to remix public domain images. There's a lot that's out there and some of it is already cataloged and interesting weights. Large language models hold the possibility of bringing out more from these public domain pictures. They can describe them they can contextualize . If formatted nicely, it could make a nice coffee table book. Alternatively, large language model, which is great at generating poetry and pros, and can create fun images just need some editorializing and some guidance to create some thing that it might be fund to learn how to publish. Who knows it might even be fun to read too.
