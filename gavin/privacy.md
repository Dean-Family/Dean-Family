# Wikipedia Wandering Wally 

## Move over World Wide Web there's another WWW in town

Wikipedia Wandering Wally is a so-called GPT. I will be including a lot of information here about this GPT, how it's implemented and some of the design philosophy behind it   However, being that this is the privacy policy for the GPT, I thought we might as well get into the privacy policy itself. 

## Privacy Policy

This GPT has an "action" that allows it to retrieve random topics from Wikipedia. It does this via API so that the results are easy to get and easy to understand for the GPT especially because I can't tell it's browsing mode to directly look at the random page link that Wikipedia publishes normally. Because I have this feature, I have to include a privacy policy. it's a bit selling them for mia's case so I have decided to use this privacy policy has a central way to communicate to any potential users of this GPT.

**There is no data collection on any user of this GPT other than whatever OpenAI is already doing.**

## Usage

Using the Wandering Wally GPT blah blah is fairly straightforward. There are several prompts they can get you started. The gist of it is that you want to start with a topic, or ask that one or more topics be generated for review. When you have decided on a topic Wandering Wally will use a regular Internet, search focused on Wikipedia, to learn more information. I decided to center the search on Wikipedia because even if you don't look at Wikipedia, searching for it helps get information that is relevant to people who are new to a topic.
