## Introduction

Hey folks, ever found yourself in the Linux distro selection maze, particularly for your AWS workloads? It's a common conundrum, one that we're exploring today, particularly between two major players: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Amazon Linux. Let's delve into the specifics!

## Amazon Linux vs. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): The Support Showdown

Before we kick things off, let's get familiar with these two contenders and what they bring to the table.

### Provider and Focus: A Cloud Native vs. A Jack of All Trades

Amazon Linux is AWS's own breed, designed to squeeze every bit of performance out of their cloud infrastructure. It's tuned for optimal results within the AWS ecosystem.

RHEL, on the other hand, is a product of Red Hat (now part of IBM), and it's built to be a Swiss Army knife of Linux distributions. It can handle a variety of scenarios, be it on-premises, cloud, or hybrid environments.

### Long-term Support: Who's In for the Long Haul?

Amazon Linux will be around in one way or another ad long as AWS is around. Each release is supported for about 2 years. RHEL, however, outlasts with a 10-year life cycle per major release, replete with updates, security patches, and extended support options.

### Support Plans: Pick Your Weapon

AWS provides a spectrum of support plans for Amazon Linux, from free Basic support to Enterprise support. You'll get 24/7 technical support, infrastructure event management, and more.

Red Hat, too, offers an array of support plans for RHEL, including Standard and Premium subscriptions, with software updates, expert technical support, and a library of resources.

### Documentation and Resources: Powering Up with Knowledge

Both AWS and Red Hat supply extensive documentation for their distros, covering installation, configuration, management, and troubleshooting. You're well-equipped on either side.

### Security: Guarding Your Fort

Both Amazon Linux and RHEL have dedicated security teams working around the clock to monitor and patch their OSes, ensuring a secure haven for your data.

### Certification and Training: Flaunt Your Expertise

Red Hat provides a comprehensive certification and training program for RHEL, including the RHCSA and RHCE certifications.

While Amazon doesn't offer Amazon Linux-specific certifications, they do have AWS certifications that cover diverse aspects of their cloud services, potentially involving Amazon Linux.

## The Killer Features: Where Amazon Linux Stands Out

### 1. Cost - Your Wallet Will Thank You!

Amazon Linux is a no-brainer if you're watching your budget. AWS Support includes Amazon Linux support akin to Red Hat's, but without any additional cost on top of your existing AWS support plan.

### 2. Patching - Effortless and Automated

Automatic patching on reboot for Amazon Linux machines keeps your instances current and secure, with zero hassle.

### 3. Compliance - Ticking All Boxes

Amazon Linux's Image Builder lets you integrate CIS controls right into your images. Compliance officers, rejoice!

### 4. Networking - Speed Is Key

Amazon Linux is the Usain Bolt of the Linux world in terms of networking. It supports the ENA, offering lower latency, higher throughput, and lower CPU utilization. Plus, it's optimized for Amazon VPC, simplifying network management.

### 5. Storage - High-Octane Performance

Amazon Linux and AWS storage services like EBS and S3 go hand in hand. Optimized drivers and configurations boost storage performance, and EBS-optimized instances increase throughput and IOPS.

### 6. Compute - Unleashing Full Power

Like a high-performance sports car built for the AWS race track, Amazon Linux's kernel is customized for AWS infrastructure, maximizing performance and resource utilization for EC2 instances. It's compatible with a wide array of EC2 instance types, including those with specialized hardware. Plus, it's known for optimizing CPU utilization. That's some serious horsepower!

## The Verdict: Amazon Linux Takes the Prize

If you're looking to make the most of your AWS workloads, Amazon Linux stands out. It offers cost-effectiveness, seamless patch management, compliance capabilities, and superior networking, storage, and compute performance. RHEL is undoubtedly a robust and versatile Linux distro, but for AWS-centric tasks, Amazon Linux is the clear winner.
