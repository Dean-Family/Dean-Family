# RHEL vs. Amazon Linux: Which is Better for Your AWS Workloads?

## Introduction

As more IT professionals move their workloads to the cloud, one of the key decisions they face is choosing the right Linux distribution for their AWS infrastructure. In this blog post, we'll compare Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Amazon Linux to help you decide which is the better choice for your AWS workloads.

## Comparing RHEL and Amazon Linux

### 1. Cost

One of the main advantages of using Amazon Linux is that AWS Support includes support commensurate with Red Hat support for Amazon Linux at no extra cost above any existing AWS support plan. This means you'll save on support costs when running Amazon Linux on AWS compared to using RHEL. However, RHEL offers a more comprehensive support system, including a 10-year support lifecycle, access to Red Hat's vast knowledge base, and a large community of users and developers.

### 2. Patching

Amazon Linux machines are automatically patched on reboot, simplifying the patch management process and ensuring instances are always up to date. RHEL also provides a robust patching system, with regular updates and security patches, ensuring that your systems remain secure and stable.

### 3. Compliance

With Image Builder, you can build CIS controls directly into your Amazon Linux images, ensuring that your instances meet compliance requirements right from the start. RHEL also offers a strong focus on security and compliance, with features like SELinux and support for various compliance standards.

### 4. Networking

Amazon Linux offers enhanced networking capabilities through its support for the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA), delivering lower latency, higher throughput, and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. Amazon Linux is also optimized for use within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). RHEL provides extensive networking features and is compatible with a wide range of hardware and software, ensuring seamless integration with various environments, including on-premises and hybrid infrastructures.

### 5. Storage

Amazon Linux is optimized for use with AWS storage services like Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Amazon S3, ensuring efficient storage performance. RHEL also offers robust storage capabilities, with support for various storage technologies and file systems, making it suitable for diverse storage needs.

### 6. Compute

The Amazon Linux kernel is tailored for use on AWS infrastructure, with specific optimizations for EC2 instances. Amazon Linux is designed to work seamlessly with various EC2 instance types, including instances with specialized hardware. RHEL provides a stable and high-performance platform suitable for a wide range of workloads and environments, with features like advanced resource management and high availability options.

### 7. Training and Certification

Amazon offers a comprehensive training and certification catalog that covers the entire AWS infrastructure. In contrast, Red Hat has a robust certification and training program specifically focused on RHEL, including the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) and Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) certifications.

## Conclusion

When it comes to running workloads on AWS, both Amazon Linux and RHEL have their unique advantages. Amazon Linux offers cost savings, simplified patch management, compliance capabilities, and optimizations for networking, storage, and compute performance tailored for AWS. RHEL, on the other hand, provides a versatile and robust Linux distribution suitable for various environments, with comprehensive support, a long support lifecycle, and a large community.

Choosing between RHEL and Amazon Linux for your AWS workloads will depend on your specific needs, priorities, and the expertise of your team. By carefully evaluating the pros and cons of each distribution, you can make an informed decision that best suits your organization's requirements.
